=>Anagram Checking Function (is_anagram):
 The function takes two input strings, removes spaces, and converts them to lowercase.It checks if the lengths of the two strings are equal. If not, they cannot be anagrams.
 Creates two dictionaries freq1 and freq2 to store the frequency of each character in the strings.
 Updates the frequency for each character in both strings.Compares the two dictionaries to check if they are equal. If they are, the strings are anagrams.

=>AWS Lambda Handler (lambda_handler):
 Gets the input strings str1 and str2 from the event.
 Calls the is_anagram function with the input strings to check if they are anagrams.Constructs a JSON response indicating whether the strings are anagrams or not.

=>Lambda Function Invocation:
 The Lambda function is designed to be invoked via an API Gateway request.
 It expects a JSON payload with keys str1 and str2, representing the input strings.
 Upon receiving the request, the Lambda function checks if the input strings are anagrams and returns a JSON response with the result.

=>Scalability:
 AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service, which means it automatically scales to handle the incoming requests.
 As more requests are made to the Lambda function, AWS automatically provisions the necessary resources to handle the load.
 
=>Cost-Efficient:
 With AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute time consumed by your function.
 Since the function is only invoked when needed, there are no costs for idle resources.

=>Easy Deployment and Management:
 The Lambda function can be easily deployed and managed through the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs.
 Updates to the function code can be made quickly and seamlessly.
 Flexibility:

**The function can be integrated with other AWS services such as API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB, etc., to build more complex applications.
It can also be used as a part of a larger serverless architecture, where multiple Lambda functions work together to achieve a common goal.
